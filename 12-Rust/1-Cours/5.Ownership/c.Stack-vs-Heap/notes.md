# Program Memory 
- **Stack**
- **Heap**

## Stack
- Values stored in sequential order
- Data added and removed as last in first out (LIFO)
- Push and pop operations
- Small memory size
- Fast access
- All data muust be known at compile time and size must be fixed

## Heap
- Adding and Accessing data is slower than stack
- Memory size is larger than stack
- Data can be added and removed in any order
- Data can be added and removed at any time
- Data can be accessed from anywhere in the program

## Stack vs Heap
| Stack | Heap |
|-------|------|
| LIFO | Data can be added and removed in any order |
| Small memory size | Large memory size |
| Fast access | Slower access |
| Data must be known at compile time | Data can be added and removed at any time |
| Data size must be fixed | Data size can be dynamic |

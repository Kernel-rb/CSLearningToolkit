/**
 * Type of inheritance  :
 *  1 - single inheritance       =   one class extends one class;
 *  2 - MultiLevel  inheritance  =   when a class inherits from another derived class, creating a chain of inheritance across multiple levels.
 *  3 - Multiple inheritance     =   not  supported in java but exist on cpp , that why we use interfaces
 *  4 - Hierarchical inheritance =   multiple classes inherit from the same base class
 *  5 - Hybrid  inheritance      =   doesn't exist in java we use interfaces  , combination of single and multiple inheritance

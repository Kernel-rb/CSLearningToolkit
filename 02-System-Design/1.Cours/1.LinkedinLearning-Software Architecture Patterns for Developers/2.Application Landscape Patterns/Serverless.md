# Serverless

- Backend as a Service (BaaS) is a cloud computing category that makes developers more productive because they don't have to manage the server infrastructure.
- Functions as a Service (FaaS) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage application functionalities without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.
- Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources.

## Advantages

- Scaling is easier

## Disadvantages

- A vendor may stop using a framework, and you may have to rewrite your code
- Cold start time can be slow (time to start a new instance of a function)
- Debugging can be more difficult

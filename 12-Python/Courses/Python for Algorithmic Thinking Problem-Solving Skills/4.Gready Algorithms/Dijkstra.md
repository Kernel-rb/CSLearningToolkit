# Dijkistra's Algorithm
- Used to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
- It is optimal 
- it uses a greedy approach to find the shortest path
- Weights must be non-negative
- It find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph

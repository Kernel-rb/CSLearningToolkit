# Algorithm Analysis
- There is 2 types of analysis:
    - Time complexity
    - Space complexity

## Time complexity
- Time complexity is a function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.

## Big O 
- Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
- Big O notation is used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
- Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

## Big omega and Big theta
- Big omega is the best case scenario
- Big theta is the average case scenario

## Exercice
- O(n+10) => O(n)
- O(100*n) => O(n)
- O(25) => O(1)
- O(n^2 + n^3) => O(n^3)
- O(n+n+n+n) => O(n)

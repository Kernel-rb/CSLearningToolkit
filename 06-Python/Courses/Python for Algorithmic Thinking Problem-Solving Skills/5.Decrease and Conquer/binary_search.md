# Binary Search

- **Binary Search** is a classic example of **Decrease and Conquer**.
- It is a technique for solving problems by reducing them to smaller versions of the same problem.
- Data must be sorted for binary search to work.
- at each step, the algorithm compares the middle element of the array to the target value.
- If the middle element is equal to the target value, the search is successful.
- If the middle element is less than the target value, the algorithm searches the right half of the array.
- If the middle element is greater than the target value, the algorithm searches the left half of the array.
- The algorithm continues to search the array until the target value is found or the array is empty.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of binary search is O(log n).
